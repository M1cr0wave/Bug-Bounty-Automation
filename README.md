##Bug Hunting Automation Framework (MERN Stack)

###Project Overview

This project is an ongoing effort (started April 2024) to develop a comprehensive framework that automates bug bounty hunting processes. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), it aims to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in vulnerability discovery.

###Key Features

FNDQ Scan Automation: Automates scans using Sublis3r and Nmap, freeing you to focus on analysis and exploitation.
Interactive Scan Data Visualization (Under Development): A planned spider feature will visually represent scan data in an interactive diagram format, facilitating a more intuitive understanding of scan results.
